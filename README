This is the official source code for the Google Calendar (Thunderbird) Tab.

I don't take feature requests or fix bugs (that I don't see myself) so if you'd like something done you have to contribute. And thanks! :-)

Here's how to contribute: `fork`, `clone`, `create`, `audit`, `commit`, `push` and then create a pull request (from a new branch, not master).  If everything looks good I'll accept your pull request and then update the add-on.
